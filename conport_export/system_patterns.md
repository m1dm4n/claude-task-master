# System Patterns

## JS_CLI_Application_TaskMaster_v1
A Node.js-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application pattern. Uses 'commander' for command parsing and argument handling. Features a modular architecture with distinct modules for core functionalities (e.g., task management, configuration, dependency management, UI). Proxies CLI calls from a main binary (`bin/task-master.js`) to a central development/execution script (`scripts/dev.js`) which then dispatches to command handlers (`scripts/modules/commands.js`). Relies on file-based data persistence (JSON for structured data like `tasks.json` and `.taskmasterconfig`, `.env` for secrets, and `.txt` for human-readable task details). Supports dynamic loading of configurations like supported AI models from a JSON file (`supported-models.json`).

## Python_AIAgentCore_Pydantic_Gemini
A Python-based AI agent core pattern. Central logic encapsulated in an assistant class (e.g., `DevTaskAIAssistant`). Leverages Pydantic for robust data modeling (e.g., `ProjectPlan`, `Task`, `AgentConfig`) and for ensuring structured interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) via the `pydantic-ai` library. Configuration is managed by a dedicated class (`ConfigManager`), loading from a JSON file and environment variables. LLM service interactions are abstracted into a service class (`LLMService`), currently focused on a specific provider (e.g., Google Gemini). Employs `asyncio` for non-blocking LLM API calls. Primary interaction is programmatic, with example usage demonstrated via a test script rather than a direct user-facing CLI.
