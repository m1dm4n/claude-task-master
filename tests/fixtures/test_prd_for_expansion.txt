# Overview  
A simple task management web application that helps teams organize, track, and collaborate on projects. The application solves the problem of scattered task information and poor project visibility by providing a centralized platform for task management with real-time updates and team collaboration features.

# Core Features  
- Task Creation and Management: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks with priorities, due dates, and status tracking
- Project Organization: Group tasks into projects with clear hierarchies and dependencies  
- Team Collaboration: Assign tasks to team members, add comments, and track progress
- Real-time Updates: Live notifications and updates when tasks change status or receive comments
- Dashboard and Reporting: Visual overview of project progress, team workload, and completion metrics

# User Experience  
- Primary Users: Project managers, team leads, and individual contributors
- Key User Flows: Create project → Add tasks → Assign to team → Track progress → Complete project
- UI/UX: Clean, intuitive interface with drag-and-drop task management and responsive design

# Technical Architecture  
- Frontend: React-based single-page application with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js REST API with Express framework
- Database: PostgreSQL for data persistence with Redis for caching
- Authentication: JWT-based user authentication and authorization
- Real-time: WebSocket connections for live updates
- Hosting: Cloud deployment with containerized services

# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: Core Foundation
- User authentication system (login, registration, password reset)
- Basic project creation and management
- Simple task CRUD operations
- Basic user interface with responsive design

## Phase 2: Enhanced Task Management  
- Task priority levels and status tracking
- Due date management and notifications
- Task assignment to team members
- Basic search and filtering capabilities

## Phase 3: Collaboration Features
- Comment system for tasks and projects
- Real-time notifications and updates
- Team member invitation and management
- Activity feed and audit trail

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Dashboard with analytics and reporting
- Task dependencies and project templates
- File attachments and integrations
- Mobile app or PWA implementation

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Authentication must be implemented first as foundation for all user-specific features
2. Basic project and task management provides the core data model
3. User interface should be usable after Phase 1 for testing and feedback
4. Team features build upon individual task management
5. Real-time features enhance existing functionality without breaking core features
6. Analytics and reporting require substantial data to be meaningful

# Risks and Mitigations  
- Technical Challenge: Real-time updates complexity → Start with polling, upgrade to WebSockets
- MVP Scope: Feature creep risk → Focus strictly on Phase 1 completeness before moving forward
- Resource Constraints: Limited development time → Prioritize core functionality over advanced features

# Appendix  
- Target Users: 5-50 person teams in software development, marketing, and operations
- Performance Requirements: Support 100+ concurrent users, <2 second page load times
- Security Requirements: HTTPS, SQL injection protection, input validation, secure session management
