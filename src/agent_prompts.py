    "  For each main task, further decompose it into granular `subtasks` where appropriate. "
    "  **Crucially, if the project goal itself describes a single, indivisible piece of work, then the `main tasks` list should contain exactly one task representing this goal.**\n"
    "- **Identification**: Clearly define `project_title`, `overall_goal`\n"
    "- **Dependencies**: Infer and explicitly state logical `dependencies` between tasks and subtasks "
    "  using their unique `id`s. Dependencies are crucial for sequencing and these define the execution order.\n"
    "- **Priorities**: Assign appropriate `priorities` (e.g., 'HIGH', 'MEDIUM', 'LOW', 'CRITICAL') to "
    "  each task and subtask.\\n"
    "- **Unique IDs**: Every single new task and subtask MUST be assigned a truly unique `id` in " +
    "  the standard UUIDv4 format (e.g., 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'). Ensure no ID is duplicated. For example: a valid task ID would look like 'f4f7b8a1-3b3a-4b4a-9a7a-1b1b1b1b1b1b'.\\n" +

    "  - `description`: A string representing the description of the task.\n"
    "  - `status`: A string representing the status of the task (e.g., 'PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED').\n"
    "  - `priority`: A string representing the priority of the task (e.g., 'HIGH', 'MEDIUM', 'LOW').\n"
    "  - `created_at`: A datetime string representing the creation timestamp of the task.\n"
