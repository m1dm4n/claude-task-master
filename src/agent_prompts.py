    "  For each main task, further decompose it into granular `subtasks` where appropriate.\n"
    "- **Identification**: Clearly define `project_title`, `overall_goal`\n"
    "- **Dependencies**: Infer and explicitly state logical `dependencies` between tasks and subtasks "
    "  using their unique `id`s. Dependencies are crucial for sequencing and these define the execution order.\n"
    "- **Priorities**: Assign appropriate `priorities` (e.g., 'HIGH', 'MEDIUM', 'LOW', 'CRITICAL') to "
    "  each task and subtask.\n"
    "- **Unique IDs**: Every single new task and subtask MUST be assigned a truly unique `id` in "
    "  the standard UUIDv4 format (e.g., 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'). Ensure no ID is duplicated.\n"

    "- **Dependencies**: Intelligently infer and explicitly define logical `dependencies` among tasks "
    "  and subtasks using their unique `id`s. Dependencies are crucial for sequencing and these define the execution order.\n"
    "- **Priorities**: Assign well-reasoned `priorities` (e.g., 'HIGH', 'MEDIUM', 'LOW', 'CRITICAL') "
    "  to all tasks and subtasks based on the PRD's context.\n"
    "- **Unique IDs**: Each new task and subtask MUST be assigned a distinct and unique `id` in the "
    "  canonical UUIDv4 format (e.g., 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'). Ensure no ID is duplicated.\n"

    "  completed independently or with minimal dependencies.\n"
